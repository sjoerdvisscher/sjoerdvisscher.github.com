<blockquote cite="http://dannyayers.com/archives/001035.html"><p>My only remaining concern is that Sean's piece could be seen to be adding to the misconception that RDF is especially difficult. In his response to Sean's piece, <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/2961">Uche</a> goes for the throat (in the nicest possible way). Classic quote, easily worth bold and italics :</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/2961"><p><b><i>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm wondering how many people actually get what relational modeling is about. A lot of people use SQL tables, but a lot of them do that by following some rules they learnt at school. But there's a huge difference between XML or relational databases and <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/"><acronym title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</acronym></a>. If the XML model or the relational model works for you, you're done. Even if the design goes against all rules. But the whole point of RDF is that the model has meaning. If you screw up, and the meaning conveyed by your RDF data is different from what you want to say, the data is effectively useless.</p><p>I really think that creating an RDF model is difficult. You not only have to wonder &#8220;does this model work for me&#8221;, but also &#8220;does this model convey what I want to say&#8221;. RDF is the only standard format that conveys meaning. That's what is great about it, and the only thing that's great about it. And your RDF is useless if it does not convey your meaning. Maybe it's not even so hard to use RDF to express what you want to say, but it is hard to say what you mean. People constantly make mistakes and don't say what to mean. (&#8220;You didn't read your e-mail?&#8221; &#8220;No, I didn't.&#8221;)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.itworld.com/nl/ebiz_ent/03182003/">Sean McGrath</a>: &#8220;I think it's time for the Semantic Web proponents to stop trying to teach us all to think at their level of abstraction.&#8221;</p><p>Great article. Of course, the proponents are quick to reply. <a href="http://dannyayers.com/ideagraph-blog/archives/001028.html">Danny Ayers</a> seems to forget that using <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/"><acronym title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</acronym></a> is not enough to interoperate. You'll need a common vocabulary. If all parties want to use this vocabulary internaly, they'll argue for years to get their little details in, which most other parties don't care about. If on the other hand all parties create their own internal format, they'll be able to get everything up and running. The experience grows, and it'll be a lot easier to agree on a common vocabulary of the data that needs to be shared among the parties.</p><p><a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/2961">Uche Ogbuji</a> thinks that Sean is arguing to quit RDF. I don't think he does. Some tasks (like gripping monkeys) don't have any better tools than monkey wrenches. If you acknowledge this, then it's obvious that development should focus on tools that allow everyone to use what they understand, instead of explaining RDF over and over again.</p>

<p><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/world/0303/coalition.nations/content.1.html">On Thursday, March 20, the U.S. State Department released a list of 42 nations it describes as the "Coalition for the Immediate Disarmament of Iraq."</a>. In the Netherlands we got a little behind the scenes look today of how weak this coalition actually is. I watched <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/22/sprj.irq.franks.ap/index.html">the briefing of general Franks</a> today. And to my huge surprise he was flanked by a Dutch officer! The Netherlands support the U.S. politicaly, but are not participating in the war. So I wondered what the hell this guy was doing there. As it turns out, the Dutch ministry of defense was asked if he was allowed to &#8220;attend a meeting&#8221;. He is a communications officer helping out with patriot installations in Turkey. That the U.S. needs him to be at this briefing shows how desparate they are to show that they have a coalition.</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1270.html"><p><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0110772/stories/2003/03/13/towardsStructuredBlogging.html">
Towards structuring blogging, Sebastien Paquet</a>: <em>I believe a critical element to get a sustainable system is for people to get reasonably quick feedback
in return for the extra effort expended in creating metadata.</em> [<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1270.html">Sam Ruby</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually I'm more and more loosing faith in anything structured in blogging. It's too hard to do right, and too much work. Also it is hard to agree on categorisations and topics. (How often did you reorder your bookmarks? I've given up.)</p>
<p>But I've not given up on the semantic web. It's just that the software needs to be smart, not the data. But in this case that's not even necessary. To know if two post are about the same subject is to see if they link to the same location. For example: to know which blog posts talk about &#8220;Towards structuring blogging&#8221;, you can simply <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fradio.weblogs.com%2F0110772%2Fstories%2F2003%2F03%2F13%2FtowardsStructuredBlogging.html&amp;btnG=Search">search for it's <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym> with Feedster</a>. If <a href="http://www.feedster.com/">Feedster</a> could provide an RSS service for search results, you get functionality comparable to what is suggested in &#8220;Towards structuring blogging&#8221;. And that is without any change in blogging tools. And the blog posts improve too, when they use more links.</p>
<p>One problem remains, a problem in general for the semantic web: Often there's not one unique URL for one topic. Try to find the <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym> for <a href="http://launch.yahoo.com/album/default.asp?albumID=1030188">Radiohead's album &#8220;Kid A&#8221;</a>. If everyone does that, we'll probably end up with about 10 different <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>s. And at least half of them will break within one year. If the semantic web is ever going to work, we'll need to actively advocate the creation of permalinks for all popular topics.</p>
<p>And for those who don't believe in the power of linking: it's exactly what your brain does.</p>

<p>Today at <a href="http://q42.nl">Q42</a> Laurens looked into <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/editions/default.asp">Microsoft Office 2003 beta 2</a>. After reading <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/02/20/08stratdev_1.html">John Udell's article about InfoPath</a> we thought Microsoft migth have caught up with <a href="http://xopus.com">Xopus</a>. Thankfully this does not seem to be the case:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/infopath/default.asp">Infopath 2003</a> uses its own templating language. It can only export to XSLT.</li>
<li>In Word 2003 you can edit a raw XML file and save it. You can also apply an XSLT transformation and edit the styled result, but you can no longer save the XML data separately after that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Office 2003 is actually a good developer tool to use with Xopus. Infopath is a nice editor for data schemas and data views. The schemas and views can then be used with Xopus to edit XML online in the browser.</p>
