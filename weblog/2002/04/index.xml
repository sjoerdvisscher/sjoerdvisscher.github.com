Sjoerd Visscher wrote me to describe his recent scraping of my site.
Below I reprint parts of his email, which I expect Sjoerd won't mind.
(This is part of a drift in the direction of expecting public exchanges.) [...] If you don't mind, I could put a link to it here for other folks to use. [<a href="http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/newApr02.htm#21apr02-scraping">David McCusker</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>I don't mind. Already 20 people are downloading <a href="http://w3future.com/weblog/staplerFeeds/mccusker.xml">the feed</a> every day. There are probably plenty more people interested. The use of public weblogs instead of e-mail is interesting. But there's  a lot to be done before it's really going to work. The biggest problem that prevents building cool tools is that there's no way to get the post that goes with a permalink.</p>

<p><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/04/29#lde6cd7c3b4ba8ac69448509c66036e87">Dave comments</a> about REST as a programming style. If there's something left of the AppleScript discussion online, I'd like to read it. I'm in the REST camp because I think it's less work. Reducing the number of verbs in <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/manilarpc">the Manila-RPC interface</a>, with the advancedPrefs API, was a big improvement IMHO.</p>

<blockquote cite="http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/2002/04/28.html"><p>I'm now convinced that one can architect a system in accordance to the principles of REST and then implement that system using RPC style, HTTP transport, POST binding, SOAP. [<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/2002/04/28.html">Sam Ruby</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>This really opened my eyes to look for what REST is really about. If I understand it correctly a RESTful RPC system has a small API. What really happens depends on the parameters, ideally some kind of (global) id. In most cases the API is something like: read, create, change and delete in one form or another. Translated to programming terms it is like having a huge set of global variables (the state of the program) which are read and written directly. Sounds like REST violates a lot of rules of both functional <i>and</i> object oriented programming.</p>

<p>I wanted to try the new Google API. And reading that <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/04/20#l79318edbf1bd2e4ab7c903c3e59756e9">Dave Winer is having fun using his Google Outline Browser</a>, I thought I'd try that too in my <a href="http://w3future.com/html/opmlloader.html#http://w3future.com/weblog/sidebars/opmlloader.opml">OPMLLoader</a>. It's a bit different from Dave's version. You can expand any link to a page and <a href="http://w3future.com/html/opmlloader.html#rel=http://w3future.com/weblog">see the related pages</a>. Dave's right, it's really fun!</p>

<h id='xmlrpcVsSoap'><a href="http://w3future.com/weblog/2002/04/19.xml#a91" class="weblogItemTitle">XML-RPC vs SOAP</a></h>
<p><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/2002/04/19.html#a377">Sam Ruby</a> is waiting for the light-bulb to go off. I think it's like this: SOAP is about XML, and XML-RPC is about scripting. When I want to call a function on my PHP server with a Javascript client, I don't want to be bothered with XML. I want the arguments to be native data structures, and the same goes for the return values. Both serverside and clientside. But when you're in a situation where you're already using XML and schemas etc., then SOAP is more powerful. Apis like Google's are used in both cases, so supporting both SOAP and XML-RPC would have been my choice.</p>
