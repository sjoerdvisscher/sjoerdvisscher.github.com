<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/01/15/apo4.html">Larry Wall: Apocalypse 4</a>. (via <a href="http://www.keithdevens.com">Keith Devens</a>)</p>
<p>In Perl 6, all blocks operate under the same rules. Effectively, every block is a kind of closure that can be run by user-defined constructs as well as built-ins.[<a href="http://lambda.weblogs.com/">Lambda the Ultimate</a>]</p></blockquote> 
<p>I really like how Larry Wall thinks about language design. He really tries to innovate, not just copy features from other languages.</p>

<blockquote><p>Here's <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/02/01/17/020117hnwinertalk.xml">UserLand's Winer</a>  talking at Infoworld's Conference on web services. He has some good points to make but then we get the old hobby horse. <em>Pointing at IBM and Microsoft, Winer said WSDL (Web Services Description Language) was invented in such a way that it will only work in Java and .Net environments. "It can't work in a dynamic environment; it's a static interface," he said.</em> I have to say, I just don't get this. [<a href="http://www.voidstar.com/node.php?id=688">jbond's blog at voidstar.com</a>]</p></blockquote> 
<p>I think I know what <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> means. Function arguments in most scripting languages aren't typed. This means that you can make an xml-rpc call, using arguments with any of the 6 types available in xml-rpc. The same with SOAP probably. The function will know how to deal with each of them. Apparently Dave says that there's no match-all type in WSDL. Is this true? I don't know.</p>
