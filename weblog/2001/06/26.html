<h2><img src="http://scripting.com/images/dailyLinkIcon.gif" height="15" width="12" alt="Permanent link to archive for 01/06/26." border="0">&nbsp;<b>Tuesday, June 26, 2001</b></h2><p><b>Scripting vs Programming</b>
<p>
<i>(Te be clear: with programming I mean languages like C and Java.)</i>
<p>
Programming is about creating programs that run efficiently.<br>
Scripting is about efficiently creating programs that run.<br>
As a result of that, programming is about manipulating data
in computer formats (ie. memory blocks), whereas scripting is about
manipulating data in "real world" form, like numbers, text, lists and
dictionaries.
<p>
So ideally scripting languages shouldn't have different types
that have different in-memory format, but the same meaning to a scripter.
And indeed most scripting languages don't have byte and word and dword
datatypes, but just one 'number' type. However, most of them do have both
records and dictionaries, while to a scripter they both are objectshttps://w3future.comhttps://w3future.comhttps://w3future.comhttps://w3future.com
with named fields.
<p>
One might argue that a scripter can always use the more general datatype,
and switch to a faster and more specific datatype when needed.
However a lot of built-in functions only allow one datatype,
leaving the scripter no choice.
<p>
What I find even more disappointing is that I've yet to find a scripting
language that has built-in support for the most popular real world data
format today: the attributed tree (ie. a model like XML). And with this I don't
mean built-in XML support, with access to the data through some (usually clumsy) API.
I mean support for objects that allow access to attributes like you would
with records or dictionaries, like <code>myObj.name="test"</code>, and
access to it's children like you would with lists, like
<code>foreach child in myObj</code>.
<p>
In fact, the attributed tree object can be the only built-in type
a scripting language would need, besides the scalar types string, date, boolean, float and number.
Javascript comes close, it implements it's arrays as dictionaries, ie.
the 0th element with key "0", the 1st element with key "1", etc.
This way it's possible to add properties (attributes) to the arrays (lists).
But it's hard and slow to manipulate such lists, and you can't use
for..in, which iterates through <em>all</em> keys.
<p>
If somebody knows a scripting language that does have proper support for attributed trees, or if there are some good papers on this subject, please let me know.

<blockquote><a href="http://markpasc.home.mindspring.com/blog/2001/06/26.html#104641AM">Mark</a>: I happened to have read most of <a href="http://diveintopython.org/"><cite>Dive Into Python</cite></a> yesterday, and this sounds like it'd be pretty easy. In fact, that seems like an easy expansion of the FileInfo example in <a href="http://diveintopython.org/fileinfo_divein.html">chapter three</a>: have an object with a string for a <code>name</code>, a dictionary <code>attr</code> of attributes, and a list <code>children</code> of more attributed trees. Do all the nice Python things like <code>for elem in tree.children</code> and list comprehensions.</blockquote>
<p>Yes, sure. But this is still an API. But why should a scripter have to write <code>tree.attr.att1</code> and <code>tree.children[1]</code>, while a parser should be able to understand both <code>tree.att1</code> and <code>tree[1]</code>. Compare it to saying that you can do garbage collecting in C++. Also there won't be a lot of usefull built-in functions that would know what to do with your tree object.
