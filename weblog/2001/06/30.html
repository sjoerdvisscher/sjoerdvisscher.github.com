<h2><img src="http://scripting.com/images/dailyLinkIcon.gif" height="15" width="12" alt="Permanent link to archive for 01/06/30." border="0">&nbsp;<b>Saturday, June 30, 2001</b></h2><p><blockquote><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/06/29">Dave</a>: BTW, on a macro level, something is seriously wrong in high-tech. Moore's curve keeps getting steeper, networking technology is <a href="http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=674230">advancing</a> at a huge pace, yet we're in a deep recession and it's getting <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/2/20076.html">deeper</a>. This should not be happening. My belief is that the flow of new user-oriented networking software has been disrupted, that's why it's slowing down. We've stopped coming up for new things for the users to do with networks. There are two reasons for this, imho.</blockquote>
<p>Maybe there's another reason. I've read a book: "The Universal Computer: The Road from Leibniz to Turing" by Martin Davis, it's a great book and it has made me a big fan of Alan Turing and of his work. Turing was the first to design a universal computer. But not exactly like the computers we use now, based on the 'von Neumann Architecture', which are just really powerful calculators; they work on numbers. Turing's computers were designed to be able to prove mathematical theories and to be smart, they work on <i>logic</i>.
<p>Before the internet, the number crunching machines were just perfect. Programming languages were designed to work with numbers, and every time new programs appeared that made use of the ever increasing power of the computer. But with the internet, our processors are doing nothing. With the internet users want to work on data, on <b>knowledge</b>. That's about logic, the number crunching machines and their programming languages are useles. So it's hard to create good internet software. That's why there's so few good new software.
<p>Even worse, the format that everyone now uses to store it's knowledge, XML, is incompatible with the currently available theories for logic. In a language like Prolog, a computer can draw conclusions from the data that is avaible to it, without having any particular knowledge about this data. You can't do that with a bunch of random XML files. You can do it with RDF, but unfortunately the W3C has decided to turn that into an an impenetrable fortress. Which is almost unbelievable, because RDF is actually nothing more than simple attributed trees.<br></p>
