<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>It seems that about every branche in the IT industry has adopted XML.
Each branch has been able to serialize its own data model into the same syntax.
This has only been possible thanks to the enormous flexibility of XML.
But this flexibility has it's downside. Each branch still uses its own data model
and it's rare that a program from one branch can read XML from another branch,
without a transformation.</p>
<p>What exactly is so flexible about XML? Nowhere in XML is implied what role
each part of the syntax plays in a data model. This makes sense because XML
is language independant and can not know what kind of data models are available.
To be able to access all XML files in a unified way, the Document Object Model
is introduced. The DOM provides an interface to the XML data, and so hides the
underlying data model. However, this is a nuisance, particularly to scripters,
who use a programming style that heavily relies on the available built-in
functions that only operate on the built-in data structures.</p>
<p>The part of XML that has been used in the most inconsistent way is the
element name. We will list the various ways element names can be used in
serializing data types, decide which is the best way, and finally creating
a rule how to consistently use element names.</p>

<h2>XML syntax for various data types</h2>
<p>So how can XML syntax be (ab)used to serialize data?
Scalar types are fairly obvious. (And when it's not obvious, it's not within the
scope of this article.) Structural types are more interesting.
When XML is concerned, there are only 2 significantly different structural types:
the <b>list</b> structure and the <b>map</b> structure.
In programming we find the list structure in f.e. normal (ordinal) arrays, tuples
and database rows. Examples of map structures are associative arrays, dictionaries,
records, structs and database columns.
